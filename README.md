# Introduction

Lobster is a workflow management tool running in userspace with no special
privileges, built to harness non-dedicated resources for high-throughput
workloads.  To be used, a head node with access to CMSSW, a proxy server,
and a Condor queue are all that is needed.

It is currently in use at the University of Notre Dame for both Monte-Carlo
event generation and analysis data processing, within the local
[CMS](http://cms.cern.ch) group.
