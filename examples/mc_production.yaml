## This is an arbitrary label for your Lobster project
id: <your id here>
## This is the area Lobster uses to store files (e.g. database, logs).  Should normally be in
## a local directory (i.e. not AFS, e.g. /tmpscratch)
workdir: <your working directory here>
## optional: to automatically update monitoring plots
plotdir: <your plotting directory here>

storage:
    shuffle inputs: false              # default is false
    shuffle outputs: false             # default is false
    use work queue for inputs: false   # default is false
    use work queue for outputs: false  # default is false
    disable input streaming: false     # default is false
    disable stage-in acceleration: false # default is false

    ## example settings for storing output at ND
    output:
      - hdfs:///store/user/<user>/<output directory>
      - file:///hadoop/store/user/<user>/<output directory>
      - srm://T3_US_NotreDame/store/user/<user>/<output directory>
      - chirp://earth.crc.nd.edu:9099/<output directory>

    # ## example settings for storing output at CERN
    # output:
    #   - "srm://srm-eoscms.cern.ch:8443/srm/v2/server?SFN=/eos/cms/store/user/<user>/<output directory>"
    #   - "root://xrootd-cms.infn.it//store/user/<user>/<output directory>"


## report tasks to the CMS dashboard (default is true)
use dashboard: true

## merge output files to this size
merge size: 3.5G

## delete intermediate files after merging (default is true)
delete merged: true

## optional: if a task exits with a code in this list, the host it ran on will be blacklisted
# bad exit codes: [1, 2]

## path to CMSSW release needed to run executable (default read from $LOCALRT)
# sandbox release top: /path/to/release

## specify sandbox instead of creating one at startup
# recycle sandbox: /path/to/sandbox.tar.bz2

## optional: specify directories in CMSSW work area to omit from sandbox
# sandbox blacklist: ['*DrawPlots*']

## DBS instance to publish to
# dbs instance: phys03

## overwrite the username to use for publishing, in case it is different from the environment var $USER
# publish user: username

## Retry accessing files only 10 times.  Requires CMSSW to be set up to
## skip input files when not accessible.
# threshold for skipping: 10
## Quit retrying units after 11 times.  After 10 failures, units are run
## once isolated by themselves.
# threshold for failure: 10

advanced:
  ## start killing tasks with excessive runtimes after this many successful
  ## tasks
  abort threshold: 10
  ## define excessive runtime in multiples of the average runtime
  # abort multiplier: 4
  ## override automatic proxy renewal
  # renew proxy: false
  ## level of verbosity.  Everything is 1, only critical messages is 5, default 2
  log level: 0
  ## how many tasks to create and keep in the queue
  # payload: 400

## Set workflow default, applied to all workflows specified below, unless they
## override certain options.
workflow defaults:
    cmssw config: mc_production.py
    ## if this is not specified, the cmssw config will be loaded to look for output modules and global tags (slower)
    outputs: [minbias.root]
    ## optional renaming of files, based on their basename and extension:
    # output format: "this_is_file_{id}_{base}.{ext}"
    publish label: 'test'
    ## default task size
    # lumis per task: 25

workflows:
  - {label: minbias, events per task: 225, num tasks: 10000}
