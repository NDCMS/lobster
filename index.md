CMS lacks tools for users to run their jobs at sites not conforming to WLCG
standards.  Lobster aims to alleviate this problem by providing a workflow
management to run jobs depending on CMSSW that does not have any specific
requirements to the cluster or need for administrative privileges.

# Features

* Access to more compute nodes
* No special access privileges or setup required
* Dynamic task handling, handling eviction
* Performance monitoring
* Historical view of system properties

# Availability

The source code is available on
[github](https://github.com/NDCMS/lobster), and has been successfully used
at both Notre Dame and CERN.
