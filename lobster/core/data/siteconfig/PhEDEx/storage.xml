<!-- storage.xml from T3_US_NotreDame

    All CMS data are stored using the /store convention
    Therefore we only need to map:
           /+store/(.*)

<storage-mapping>

<!-- Translation rules for LFN to PFN (Logical File Name to Physical File Name 
     Bestman does not support the srm v1 protocol so we fudge it with a file result
-->

  <lfn-to-pfn protocol="file"
    path-match="/+store/(.*)" result="file:/store/$1"/>
<!-- Xrootd fallback rules -->
  <lfn-to-pfn protocol="xrootd" destination-match=".*" path-match="/+store/(.*)" result="root://xrootd.unl.edu//store/$1"/>


<!-- Translation rules for PFN to LFN (Physical File Name to Logical File Name -->

  <pfn-to-lfn protocol="file"
    path-match="file:/store/(.*)" result="/store/$1"/>
