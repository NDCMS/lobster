title: Papers & Talks
---

We are in the process of preparing several publications, both within the
computer science and high energy physics community.  These papers and
posters will focus on different aspects of Lobster:

* [Opportunistic Computing with Lobster: Lessons Learned from Scaling up to 25k Non-Dedicated Cores][chep2016]

  Talk presented at the 22nd International Conference
  on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP2016.)

* [Scaling Data Intensive Physics Applications to 10k Cores on Non-Dedicated
  Clusters with Lobster][IEEE2015]

  Accepted to IEEE Cluster 2015.

* Exploiting Volatile Opportunistic Computing Resources as a CMS
  User [[abstract]][chep][[poster]][poster]

  A poster accepted for presentation at the 21st International Conference
  on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP2015.)

* [Opportunistic High Energy Physics Computing in User Space with
  Parrot][crab]

  This paper predated Lobster, but it set a lot of the
  groundwork by showing the feasibility of opportunistic
  computing with the CMS software framework.
