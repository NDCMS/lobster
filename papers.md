title: Papers & Talks

We are in the process of preparing several publications, both within the
computer science and high energy physics community.  These papers and
posters will focus on different aspects of Lobster:

* Scaling Data Intensive Physics Applications to 10k Cores on Non-Dedicated
  Clusters with Lobster

  In preparation, to be submitted it IEEE Cluster 2015.

* [Exploiting Volatile Opportunistic Computing Resources as a CMS
  User][chep]

  A poster accepted for presentation at the 21st International Conference
  on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP2015.)

* [Opportunistic High Energy Physics Computing in User Space with
  Parrot][crab]

  This paper predated Lobster, but it set a lot of the
  groundwork by showing the feasibility of opportunistic
  computing with the CMS software framework.
